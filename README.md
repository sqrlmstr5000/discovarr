## Background

The original intent was to write a script to generate a prompt that gave me recommendations that were not in my media library. After I got that working I decided to turn this into a full application. Hope you find it useful as well!

## Scheduled Tasks
- The `sync_watch_histry` job that runs at midnight every night to sync the watch history for each user to the `watchhistory` table. This job can be triggered manually on the Watch History tab. It uses the `app.recent_limit` setting to control how many items for each user to sync. 
- The `recently_watched` default search queries the `watchistory` table, returing a set number of items based on the `app.recent_limit` setting. It then submits a prompt to the Gemini API using the prompt associated with the search. The `{{limit}}` prompt template variable is set using the `gemini.limit` setting. Results are saved to the `media` table and displayed on the Home tab. The default search is not scheduled initially. 

## Search
- Custom searches can be created and run ad-hoc, results are displayed and can be automatically saved with the `app.auto_media_save` setting. Saved searches are saved to the `media` table automatically. 
- Searches support various template variables like `{{media_name}}` `{{limit}}` `{{all_media}}` `{{favorites}}` that will be auto-populated at runtime. `{{media_name}}` is used to populate the Source column linking recommendations to the source title. Use the Preview button to preview the generated prompt before submitting. 
- The Search button next to items in Watch History or Home will navigate to the Search page and auto-populate the `{{media_name}}` variable accordingly.

## Possible Roadmap
- Integration with other AI providers like OpenAI, Claude, etc. 
    - Gemini was choosen due to their generous free tier. 
- Overseer and Jellyseer integration. 
    - I don't use these but would be willing to consider supporting them. 
- SmartCollections using LLM directly or potentially a RAG vector search with LangFlow

## Docker Compose Example

- This example `compose.yml` demonstrates the minimum config for the Discovarr container.
- Environment variables can be set according to your specific setup and will populate Settings on first launch.
- Volumes used in the container are `/config` and `/backups`. Map `/config` to a path on your host to persist the database between container restarts. 
- The container does not run as root and uses a `discovarr` user and group with UID/GID `1884` by default. The `entrypoint.sh` script will create this user/group within the container and ensure proper directory permissions. 
- If you want to change the `1884` UID/GID use the `PUID` and `PGID` environment variables. 

```yaml
services:
  discovarr:
    image: ghcr.io/sqrlmstr5000/discovarr:latest 
    container_name: discovarr
    restart: unless-stopped
